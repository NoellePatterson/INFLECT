# INFLection-based Elevations from Channel Topography (INFLECT)

INFLECT is a software tool used to identify persistent topographic features of river corridors, such as bankfull and flood terraces. INFLECT uses cross-sections derived from digital elevation models to identify abrupt changes in cross-section width, which are indicative of topographic features. Inputs to INFLECT are a DEM, a river thalweg/centerline, and a set of transects spanning the study reach. Outputs include a series of diagnostic figures described below, a set of elevations representing major topographic feature locations on the study reach, and a shapefile of topographic feature locations along the input transects.
